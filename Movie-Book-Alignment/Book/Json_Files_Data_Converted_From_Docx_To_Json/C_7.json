[{"C7": ""}, {"A little while later, Judy was writing parking tickets in Sahara Square when she noticed Nick and his kid a few blocks away.\u201cOh! Hey, little toot-toot! \u201d she called, waving, but they didn't see her.": ""}, {"She started toward them but stopped suddenly when she realized what they were doing. They were melting the giant Jumbo-pop she had bought for them in the hot sun.Then they were channeling the juice into little jugs. Judy furrowed\ufffc her brow as she watched Nick and his kid packing the full jugs into the back of a van. Her eyes nearly fell out of her head when she saw Nick's little son get into the driver's seat! Then they drove off. Judy was shocked and confused.": ""}, {"She hopped in her cart and followed them to the coldest section of Zootopia\u2014Tundratown. Nick's son was using his little paws to make molds in the snow, which Nick then put sticks in. Then the two poured the juice from the melted Jumbo-pop into the molds to create dozens of smaller pops! Judy looked on, scandalized\ufffc. She couldn't believe it!": ""}, {"Judy followed them again, this time to Savanna Central, where they set up a stand and sold \u201cpawpsicles\ufffc \u201d at marked-up prices to lemmings\ufffc.": ""}, {"\u201cPawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles! \u201d barked Nick.": ""}, {"One lemming bought an icy treat, and then the rest of them followed. In an instant, the frozen desserts were completely sold out! Once the lemmings finished their pawpsicles, they threw the sticks into a recycling bin.When the lemmings were gone, a small door opened in the bin and the little fox\u2014who, Judy realized, was not an adorable toddler but a fully grown Fennec fox named Finnick\u2014stepped out with a bundle of used pawpsicle sticks. Judy was having trouble believing her eyes.": ""}, {"She continued to follow Nick and Finnick to Little Rodentia, where Nick plopped down the bundle of used sticks in front of a mouse construction worker and shouted, \u201cLumber delivery! \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cWhat's with the color? \u201d asked the construction worker.": ""}, {"\u201cThe color? It's red wood, \u201d answered Nick, shrugging off the question as he accepted his payment.": ""}, {"The construction workers hauled\ufffc the sticks away, and Judy watched in awe as Nick handed Finnick his share of the cash.": ""}, {"\u201cThirty-nine\u2026 forty. There you go. Way to work that diaper\ufffc, big guy. What, no kiss bye-bye for Daddy? \u201d Nick asked jokingly.": ""}, {"\u201cYou kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off, \u201d said Finnick in a deep voice. \u201cCiao.\u201dFinnick hopped into his van and drove off, blaring loud rap music.": ""}, {"Judy appeared in front of Nick, her face burning with anger. \u201cI stood up for you. And you lied to me! You liar! \u201d she yelled.": ""}, {"\u201cIt's called a hustle\ufffc, sweetheart, \u201d said Nick coolly. \u201cAnd I'm not the liar, he is.\u201d Nick pointed behind Judy. She turned but saw no one standing there. When she whipped back around, Nick was gone! Then she spotted his tail disappearing behind a corner.": ""}, {"\u201cHey, \u201d she said, hurrying to catch up as Nick strolled along. \u201cAll right, slick Nick, you're under arrest.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cReally, for what? \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cGee, I don't know. How about selling food without a permit, transporting undeclared\ufffc commerce\ufffc across borough lines, false advertising\u2014\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cPermit.\u201d Nick smiled as he showed Judy the document. \u201cReceipt of declared commerce.\u201d He showed her a receipt. \u201cAnd I did not falsely advertise anything. Take care.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cYou told that mouse the pawpsicle sticks were redwood, \u201d Judy said.": ""}, {"\u201cThat's right, \u201d said Nick smugly. \u201cRed. Wood. With a space in the middle. Wood that is red. You can't touch me, Carrots. I've been doing this since I was born.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cYou're gonna want to refrain from calling me Carrots.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cMy bad, \u201d said Nick. \u201cI just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot-choked Podunk, no? \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cAh, no, \u201d Judy replied, as if to say \u201cobviously not.\u201d \u201cPodunk is in Deerbrooke County. I grew up in Bunnyburrow.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cOkay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar.\u201d Nick's tone changed as he began to talk quickly and boldly. \u201cNa\u00efve little hick\ufffc with good grades and big ideas decides, \u2018Hey, look at me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia, where predators and prey live in harmony and sing \u201cKumbaya\u201d! ' Only to find\u2014whoopsie, we don't all get along. And that dream of being a big-city cop? Double whoopsie! She's a meter maid. And whoopsie number threesie, no one cares about her or her dreams. Soon enough those dreams die and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor\ufffc, living in a box under a bridge. Until, finally, she has no choice but to go back home with that cute fuzzy wuzzy tail between her legs to become\u2014You're from Bunnyburrow? So let's say a carrot farmer? Sound about right? \u201d": ""}, {"Judy stood speechless. She couldn't believe Nick had figured out her fears so quickly. A passing rhino almost pushed her down, knocking her out of her thoughts.": ""}, {"\u201cBe careful now, \u201d warned Nick. \u201cOr it won't just be your dreams getting crushed.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cHey, hey! \u201d she said, trying to pull herself together. \u201cNo one tells me what I can or can't be! Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to try and be anything more than a pawpsicle hustler.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cAll right, look, everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they can be anything they want. Well, you can't. You can only be what you are.\u201d He pointed to himself. \u201cSly\ufffc fox.\u201dThen he pointed to her. \u201cDumb\ufffc bunny.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cI am not a dumb bunny.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cRight. And that's not wet cement.\u201d": ""}, {"Judy looked down to see that she was ankle-deep in gooey\ufffc wet cement. She sighed in dismay.": ""}, {"\u201cYou'll never be a real cop, \u201d Nick said obnoxiously\ufffc. \u201cYou're a cute meter maid, though. Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there.\u201d": ""}, {"Frustrated, Judy watched as Nick walked off. Then she set about pulling her paws out of the cement.": ""}]
