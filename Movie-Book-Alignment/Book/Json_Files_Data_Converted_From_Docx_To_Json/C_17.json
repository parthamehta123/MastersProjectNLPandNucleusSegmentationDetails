[{"C17": ""}, {"Judy confidently led the cops up to the canopy. \u201cI thought this was just a missing mammal case, but it's way bigger. Mr. Otterton did not just disappear. I believe he and this jaguar\u2026 they went savage, sir.\u201d": ""}, {"Bogo scoffed\ufffc. \u201cSavage? This isn't the Stone Age, Hopps. Animals don't go savage.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cI thought so, too, until I saw this.\u201d Judy turned the corner where she had handcuffed Manchas\u2014but he was gone! Even the handcuffs had vanished.": ""}, {"\u201cHe was right here, \u201d she said, confused.": ""}, {"\u201cThe \u2018savage' jaguar, \u201d said Bogo, scoffing once again.": ""}, {"\u201cSir, I know what I saw. He almost killed us, \u201d said Judy.": ""}, {"\u201cOr maybe an aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits, \u201d Bogo said. He called out to the other officers, \u201cLet's go.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cWait\u2014sir, I'm not the only one who saw him! \u201d": ""}, {"Judy called to Nick, but before he could explain, Bogo said, \u201cYou think I'm going to believe a fox? \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cWell, he was a key witness, and I enlisted\ufffc his services, \u201d Judy said.": ""}, {"Bogo shook his head, annoyed. \u201cTwo days to find the otter\u2026 or you quit\u2026 that was the deal. Badge, \u201d he said, waiting for her to hand her badge over.": ""}, {"Nick watched Judy stare at Bogo's outstretched hand. \u201cSir, we\u2026\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cBadge, \u201d said Bogo firmly.": ""}, {"Judy slowly reached for it as Nick spoke up. \u201cUh, no, \u201d he said.": ""}, {"Bogo glared at Nick. \u201cWhat did you say,fox? \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cSorry, what I said was \u2018no.' She will not be giving you that badge, \u201d said Nick. \u201cLook, you gave her a clown vest and a three-wheel joke-mobile\ufffc and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah, no wonder she needed to get help from a fox. None of you guys were gonna help her, were you? \u201d": ""}, {"Judy stared at Nick. She couldn't believe he was sticking up for her. Bogo stood silently.": ""}, {"\u201cHere's the thing, Chief. You gave her forty-eight hours, so technically we still have ten left to find our Mr. Otterton\u2026 and that's exactly what we are gonna do. So if you'll excuse us\u2026 we have a very big lead\ufffc to follow and a case to crack. Good day.\u201d": ""}, {"Nick turned to Judy. \u201cOfficer Hopps? \u201d He guided her to a passing gondola, leaving Bogo and the rest of the officers stunned.\ufffc": ""}, {"\u201cThank you, \u201d she said as the two sat in the gondola while it soared over the Rainforest District.": ""}, {"\u201cNever let them see that they get to you, \u201dsaid Nick.": ""}, {"Surprised, Judy turned to Nick. \u201cSo things get to you? \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cNo\u2026 I mean, not anymore, \u201d said Nick.\u201cBut I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cHar-har, \u201d said Judy.": ""}, {"\u201cNo, it's true. I think I was eight, maybe nine, and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts\ufffc.\u201d": ""}, {"Nick decided to tell Judy a story about when he was a kid. \u201cSo my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand-new uniform.\u201d Nick explained how badly he wanted to fit in\u2014even though he was the only predator in the troop. \u201cI was gonna be part of a pack, \u201d he said.": ""}, {"Nick described the scene. He was taking the oath with the scouts when the other kids suddenly tackled him, yelling, \u201cGet him! Get that pred! Muzzle\ufffc him! \u201d": ""}, {"They strapped a muzzle onto his snout and continued to mock him. \u201cIf you thought we'd ever trust a fox without a muzzle, you're even dumber than you look, \u201d one of them had taunted.": ""}, {"When they finally let him go, he ran away, limping, with his uniform torn to pieces.": ""}, {"\u201cI learned two things that day, \u201d said Nick, lost in the terrible memory. \u201cOne, I was never going to let anyone see that they got to me.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cAnd two? \u201d Judy prodded\ufffc.": ""}, {"\u201cNick, \u201d said Judy gently. \u201cYou are so much more than that.\u201d She touched his arm as the gondola pierced through the clouds.

The Jam Cams! \u201d said Nick urgently.": ""}, {"\u201cSeriously, it's okay, \u201d said Judy.": ""}, {"\u201cN-no, shh-shush! There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy. Whatever happened to that jaguar\u2014\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cThe traffic cameras would have caught it! \u201d said Judy, excitedly, suddenly realizing what Nick meant.": ""}, {"\u201cBingo! \u201d said Nick.": ""}, {"Judy chucked him on the arm, impressed.\u201cPretty sneaky, Slick.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cHowever. If you didn't have access to the system before, I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna give it to you now.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cNo. But I've got a friend at city hall who might! \u201d Judy smiled, feeling hopeful again.": ""}]
