[{"C3": ""}, {"Fifteen years later, Judy Hopps worked her tail off in the Zootopia Police Academy.

Cadets had to get through obstacles in simulators\ufffc that mimicked all of the twelve unique ecosystems\ufffc that made up the city of Zootopia. From freezing Tundratown to sweltering Sahara Square, each ecosystem presented its own set of challenges\u2014whether it was trying to scale an ice wall or survive in a scorching\ufffc sandstorm.": ""}, {"Judy fell down more than anyone. In her mind she could hear the voices of her parents, her drill instructor, and Gideon Grey all doubting that there could ever be a bunny cop. And it was those voices that made Judy work harder than anyone else. Through persistence\ufffc and perseverance\ufffc, she managed to keep up and surprise everyone.": ""}, {"In the final weeks of training, Judy used her bunny skills, like her strong legs and her great hearing, to help prove her worth. She sailed through the physical obstacles and at times even passed the other cadets. Once, she knocked down a male rhino ten times her size during a final sparring session!": ""}, {"On graduation day, Judy took her place among the other graduates during the ceremony, including the rhino who sported a fat lip and a black eye.
