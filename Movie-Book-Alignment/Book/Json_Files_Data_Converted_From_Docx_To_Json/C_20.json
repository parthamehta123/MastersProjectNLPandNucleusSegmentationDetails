Behind him were posters of the savage animals\u2014each one of them sporting a muzzle. \u201cLadies and gentlemammals, \u201d said Bogo. \u201cFourteen mammals went missing, and all fourteen have been found by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cI am so nervous, \u201d said Judy as she and Nick stood off to the side.": ""}, {"\u201cOkay, Press Conference 101, \u201d said Nick. \u201cYou wanna look smart, answer their questions with your own rhetorical\ufffc questions. Then answer that question. Okay like this, \u2018Was this a tough case? Yes. Yes, it was.' \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cYou should be up there with me. We did this together, \u201d said Judy.": ""}, {"\u201cWell, am I a cop? No. No, I'm not, \u201danswered Nick.": ""}, {"\u201cFunny you should say that\u2026 because I've been thinking. It would be nice to have a partner, \u201d said Judy, handing Nick an application to the ZPD. She offered the carrot pen to him. \u201cHere. In case you need something to write with.\u201d": ""}, {"Bellwether gestured to Judy to come up to the podium\ufffc. \u201cOfficer Hopps, it's time.\u201d": ""}, {"Nick looked down at the application, clicked the pen, and began filling it out.": ""}, {"As Judy stepped up, Bogo saluted\ufffc her.

Judy pointed to one of them. \u201cWhat can you tell us about the animals that went savage? \u201d the reporter asked.": ""}, {"\u201cWell, the animals in question\u2026 Are they all different species? Yes. Yes, they are, \u201d said Judy, looking toward Nick.": ""}, {"Nick smiled and gave her a thumbs-up.": ""}, {"\u201cOkay, what's the connection? \u201d shouted another reporter.": ""}, {"\u201cAll we know is that they're all members of the predator family, \u201d said Judy.": ""}, {"Nick frowned. The press reacted. Again, they yelled questions all at once. Judy was surprised.": ""}, {"\u201cSo predators are the only ones going savage? \u201d demanded one reporter.": ""}, {"\u201cThat is accurate, \u201d said Judy, hesitating before she spoke. \u201cYes.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cWhy is that happening? \u201d yelled several reporters.": ""}, {"\u201cWe still don't know\u2014\u201d": ""}, {"The crowd rumbled\ufffc with disappointment.": ""}, {"\u201cBUT, but, but\u2026 it may have something to do with biology, \u201d said Judy, surprised by the escalating\ufffc tension in the room.": ""}, {"Murmurs rippled across the press and a reporter asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by that? \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cA biological component.

Can you elaborate\ufffc on that, please? \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cYes, \u201d Judy nodded, as the crowd got louder. \u201cThousands of years ago\u2026 predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts.
