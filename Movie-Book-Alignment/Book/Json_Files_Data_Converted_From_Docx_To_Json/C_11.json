Flies buzzed around his unshowered body. \u201cOooooooohmmmmm, \u201dhe chanted. The tone of the buzzing flies seemed to match the tone of his voice.\u201cOooooooohmmmmm.\u201d": ""}, {"Judy approached Yax. \u201cHello! My name is\u2014\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cOh, you know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there. We are all good on Bunny Scout Cookies, \u201d said Yax, who talked slowly, almost as if he wasn't quite there.": ""}, {"\u201cI am Officer Hopps, ZPD. I am looking for a missing mammal, Emmitt Otterton\u201d\u2014she showed him the picture\u2014\u201cwho may have frequented this establishment.\u201d": ""}, {"Yax looked at the photo and his eyes widened, as if he was about to say something important.": ""}, {"\u201cAH-CHOO! \u201d he sneezed, and flies scattered everywhere before returning to their place, hovering around him. \u201cYep, Ol' Emmitt. Haven't seen him in a couple weeks. But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor. I'd be happy to take you back.\u201d Yax nodded toward a different area of the club.": ""}, {"\u201cThank you so much, \u201d said Judy. \u201cThat would be a big\u2014\u201d Yax came around from behind the counter, and Judy was unable to complete her sentence when she saw what he was\u2014or wasn't\u2014wearing. \u201cYou are naked! \u201d": ""}, {"\u201cHuh? Oh, for sure, we're a Naturalist Club, \u201d said Yax nonchalantly\ufffc.": ""}, {"\u201cYeah, in Zootopia anyone can be anything\u2026, \u201d said Nick, grinning, \u201cand these guys, they be naked.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cNanga's on the other side of the pleasure pool, \u201d offered Yax. \u201cRight this way, folks.\u201d": ""}, {"Judy's jaw dropped as she wondered what a pleasure pool was. When they got there, naked animals were sunning themselves, playing, and lounging around. Judy's eyes nearly popped out of her head at the sight. Nick leaned over to her. \u201cDoes this make you uncomfortable? Because there is no shame in calling it quits. We could end our deal right now.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cYes, there is, \u201d she said. She was determined more than ever to stay on the case.": ""}, {"\u201cBoy, that's the spirit, \u201d joked Nick.": ""}, {"Out in the courtyard, Judy tried to act normal. Her eyes darted around, looking for a neutral place to land.": ""}, {"\u201cYeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird, \u201d said Yax. \u201cBut you know what I say is weird? Clothes on animals! Here we go. As you can see, Nanga's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything.\u201d": ""}, {"Nanga looked curiously at the newcomers.": ""}, {"\u201cHey, Nanga, these dudes have some questions about Emmitt the otter, \u201d said Yax.": ""}, {"\u201cWho? \u201d Nanga asked.": ""}, {"\u201cEmmitt Otterton, \u201d Yax prompted\ufffc. \u201cBeen coming to your yoga class for like six years.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cI have no memory of this beaver, \u201d Nanga stated.": ""}, {"\u201cYeah, he's an otter, actually, \u201d Judy corrected, looking over at Nick in dismay.": ""}, {"\u201cHe was here a couple Wednesdays ago. 'Member? \u201d Yax prompted Nanga.": ""}, {"But the elephant just shook her head.\u201cNope.\u201d": ""}, {"\u201cYeah, \u201d Yax continued. \u201cHe was wearing a green cable-knit sweater-vest and a new pair of corduroy\ufffc slacks. Oh, and a paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot\ufffc, real tight. Remember that, Nanga? \u201d": ""}, {"Judy couldn't believe her luck. Yax was a gold mine! She scrambled to write everything down.": ""}, {"\u201cNo, \u201d Nanga said again.": ""}, {"\u201cUh, ah, you didn't happen to catch the license plate number did you? \u201d Judy asked.": ""}, {"\u201cOh, for sure, \u201d Yax nodded. \u201cIt was 29THD03.\u201d": ""}, {"Judy's pen moved quickly. \u201c\u201403.

And seeing as how any moron\ufffc can run a plate, I'll take that pen and bid you adieu.\u201d": ""}, {"Judy held out the pen, but as Nick went to reach for it, she realized something. She pulled it back before he could swipe it. \u201cThe plate\u2026 I can't run the plate\u2026 I'm not in the system yet.\u201dShe put the pen back in her pocket and smiled at Nick.": ""}, {"\u201cWhat was it you said? \u2018Any moron can run a plate'? Gosh\u2026 if only there were a moron around who was up to the task\u2026, \u201d she said.": ""}, {"\u201cRabbit, I did what you asked; you can't keep me on the hook forever, \u201d said Nick.": ""}, {"\u201cNo, not forever. I have\u201d\u2014Judy paused as she checked her phone\u2014\u201cthirty-six hours left to solve this case.
