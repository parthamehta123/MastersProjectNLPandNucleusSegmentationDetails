Inside the Department of Mammal Vehicles, there was a huge line of animals waiting to be helped.
“They're all sloths￼! ” Judy exclaimed, noticing the employees. Nick smiled. “You said this was going to be quick! ”
“What? Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast? ” Nick said innocently.“I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything.”
Nick led Judy over to his friend, Flash, who was sitting behind the counter at one of the windows. “Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash! ” said Nick. “Buddy, it's nice to see ya.”
Flash looked at Nick for a long beat. “Nice to… see you… too, ” he said slowly.
“Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend. Darling, I seem to have forgotten your name.”
“Officer Judy Hopps, ” said Judy, showing her badge. “ZPD. How are you? ”
Flash looked at her and didn't respond for a good ten seconds. “I am… doing… just—”
Judy couldn't take it. “Fine? ” she offered, trying to move the conversation along.
“… as well… as… I can… be. What—” Flash continued.
“Hang in there, ” said Nick, loving every second.
“… can I… do… ”
“Well, I was hoping you could run a plate—”
“… for you … ”
“Well, I was hoping you could—”
“… today? ” Flash asked, finally completing his sentence.
“Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us. We're in a really big hurry, ” answered Judy.
Flash waited a moment before beginning his response. “Sure. What's the… plate—”
“Two nine—” Judy began.
“… number? ” asked Flash.
Judy took a deep breath. “29THD03.”
Flash took another moment before repeating it. “Two… nine… ”
“THD03, ” said Judy.
“T, ” said Flash.
It took quite a while for Flash to enter the first part of the license plate number into the system. Just as he was about to punch in the last digit￼, Nick interrupted him. “Hey, Flash, you wanna hear a joke? ”
“No! ” Judy yelled.
“What do you call a three-humped camel? ”
“I don't… know. What do… you call… a—”
“Three-humped camel, ” said Judy quickly, trying to get the joke out of the way.
“… three-humped… camel? ” said Flash.
“Pregnant, ” answered Nick.
Flash showed no reaction at first, but then he slowly raised his head as a smile crept￼ across his face. “Ha… ha… ha… ha… ”
Judy's impatience grew. “Ha, ha, yes, very funny, very funny. Can we please just focus on the—”
Flash turned toward the sloth next to him.“Hey, Priscilla…”
“Yes… Flash? ” answered Priscilla, just as slowly.
“What… do… you call… a—”
“A three-humped camel? Pregnant! ”shouted Judy, thoroughly frustrated.
“Three… humped… ” Judy was losing her mind. “Aaaaaaaaaagh! ”
Hours after they'd entered, a dot-matrix printer slowly spat out the address for the license plate number.
“Here you…, ” said Flash, handing it to Judy.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah… thank you! ” she said.
“… go.”
“29THD03, ” said Judy, frantically reading the printout. “It's registered to… Tundratown Limo￼-Service? A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown— It's in Tundratown! ”
“Way to hustle, buddy, ” Nick said to Flash.“I love you. I owe you.”
“Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour and—” Judy said as she hurried through the door to get outside. “IT'S NIGHT! ” She looked at the sky in awe. It was completely dark.
They had been in there for hours! Judy was running out of time.
