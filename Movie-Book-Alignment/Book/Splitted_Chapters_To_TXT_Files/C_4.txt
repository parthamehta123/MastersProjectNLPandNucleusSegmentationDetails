As the train came around a bend, Judy gazed out the window at the incredible sight in the distance: Zootopia. She pressed her face against the glass and watched each borough￼ of the city pass by.
Judy exited the train at Central Station, which served downtown Zootopia, and made her way outside into the city's central plaza. It was incredible! She took out her earbuds￼ and let the chaotic￼ city sounds wash over her as she looked around, awestruck. Animals of all shapes and sizes rushed by, hurrying this way and that. It was a far cry￼ from Bunnyburrow!
She looked down at her phone and checked her maps app to figure out which way to go.
When she found her apartment building, the landlady, Dharma, an armadillo, led her to a little apartment.
“Welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms, ”said Dharma, stepping aside to let Judy in.“Complimentary￼ delousing once a month. Don't lose your key.”
Kudu and Oryx, Judy's neighbors, passed in the hallway. Judy greeted them warmly. “Oh, hi, I'm Judy. Your new neighbor.”
“Yeah, well, we're loud, ” said Kudu.
“Don't expect us to apologize for it, ” added Oryx.
The two hurried off, slamming the door of their apartment behind them. Dharma had leftas well, leaving Judy alone in her apartment for the first time. She looked around.
“Greasy walls… rickety bed…, ” said Judy.
Then loud voices came from the other side of the wall: “Shut up! ” “You shut up! ” “No! You shut up! ”
“Crazy neighbors.” Judy flopped onto the bed with a big smile. “I love it! ”
